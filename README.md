JS: Restaurant page. This is the third project of "The Odin Project" JavaScript module. In this project, we have used import/export ES6 modules. 
It is a kind of SPA(single page application) having only one html file and have different JavaScript modules for different webpages. To bundle all the modules, we have used webpack.
